Moving on to the building part of the project, here is an overview of what we are doing.

- We are going to pull this repo: https://github.com/yosang/aci-helloworld
- We are going to inspect the contents using `tree` and `ls -la`
- We are going to leave all files as is and only modify `app/index.html`
    - Change the header text
    - Change the SVG image
- Build an image using `docker build -t name:tag .` from `Dockerfile` in the root directory.
- Tag the newly created image with `[registry_name].azurecr.io/[image_name]`
- Push the image wit `docker push`
